# SeQUeNCe Simulator Hands-On

This folder contains all of the Jupyter notebooks for the SeQUeNCe simulator hands-on session on Friday. To run each notebook, you will need to install the simulator from the separate repository [here](https://github.com/sequence-toolbox/SeQUeNCe) before the session on Friday.

To install the simulator, simply download the repository, navigate to its directory, and install with pip as
```
$ pip install .
```
or with the included makefile as
```
$ make install
```
These directions are also restated in the SeQUeNCe directory.
