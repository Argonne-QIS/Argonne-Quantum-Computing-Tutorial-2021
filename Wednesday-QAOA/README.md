#### Prerequisites 
 
The recommended platform for running these notebooks is IBM IQX. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks on your local machine, but that would require you setting up the environment with Python 3 and installing Qiskit (additional instructions are available in the notebook). To create an account, go to https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/ and login with an IBM ID. If you do not have an IBM ID, please create one.
 
After logging in, go to IBM Quantum Jupyter Lab:
