Day 2: Hands-on session on VQE

1. In the first notebook, you will learn how to set up the electronic structure problem and map it onto qubits

2. In the second notebook, you will learn how to set up a variational ansatz, chemistry inspired or hardware efficient, run VQE simulation using various optimizers, and monitor convergence of VQE simulations. In this section we work with statevector simulator, which works with matrices instead of probabilistic quantum measurements.

3. In the third notebook, we are going to look at simulations with noise. First, we will use aer_simulator to run simulations with stochastic noise (no hardware noise). Then, we will use the simulator of the real quantum device with noise and learm how to mitigate measurement errors.
